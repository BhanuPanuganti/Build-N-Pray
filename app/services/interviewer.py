"""The conversational interviewer behind the project and fundamentals rounds.

There is no fixed question list. The agent plans a few skills to verify, asks one
question at a time, and after every answer decides what a good human interviewer
would do next: dig deeper, chase something the candidate brought up, move on, or
close the round. Each answer is rated privately; the per-skill verdicts reach the
candidate only in the report.

Session bookkeeping lives in app.services.conversation. This module only talks to
the model and validates what comes back.
